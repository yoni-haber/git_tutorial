Git is a version control system which allows you to track and make changes to files
Used for collaboration on a project or by individual developers
A repository contains a collection of files and version information
The repository tracks all changes made to a file over time
Git records and stores these changes, allowing you to reference them as needed.

git init - to initialise a new Git project 
This command sets up all the toold Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project 

A Git project has a Git workflow which can be thought of having 3 parts:
A working directory - creating, editing, deleting and organising files
A staging area - list changes you make to the working directory 
A repository - where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project

In Git, we save changes with a commit.
You can check the status of changing the contents of the working directory using 'git status' 

For Git to start tracking, the file needs to be added to the staging area using 'git add filename'

If content is added to the file you can check the differences between the working directory and the staging area with 'git diff filename'

A commit permanently stores chnages from the staging area inside the repository using 'git commit -m', followed by a message that describes the point of the commit
commit messages must be in " ", written in present tense and should be less than 50 characters
